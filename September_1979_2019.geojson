Arctic sea ice keeps the polar regions cool and helps moderate global climate.  Sea ice has a bright surface, so 80 percent of the sunlight that strikes it is reflected back into space. As sea ice melts in the summer, it exposes the dark ocean surface. Instead of reflecting 80 percent of the sunlight, the ocean absorbs 90 percent of the sunlight. The oceans heat up, and Arctic temperatures rise further.  A small temperature increase at the poles leads to still greater warming over time, making the poles the most sensitive regions to climate change on Earth.  According to scientific measurements, both the thickness and summer sea ice extent in the Arctic have shown a dramatic decline over the past thirty years. This is consistent with observations of a warming Arctic. The loss of sea ice also has the potential to accelerate global warming trends and to change climate patterns.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Antarctic Sea Ice Extent", "description": null, "visibility": -1, "This KMZ file shows average Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent": null, "Field_3": " This KMZ file shows average Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent for each September from 1979-2017, as derived from SSM\/I-SSMIS passive microwave satellite data. In September, Arctic sea ice is at its minimum extent, and Antarctic sea  ice is at its maximum extent. Wintertime Antarctic sea ice is increasing at a small rate and with substantial natural year-to-year variability in the time series. The increase in Antarctic sea ice extent is not surprising to climate  scientists. Even if wintertime Antarctic sea ice were to increase or  decrease significantly in the future, it would not have a huge impact on the climate system. During the Antarctic winter, energy from the  sun is at its weakest point; the ability or inability of Antarctic sea  ice to reflect the sun's energy back into space has little affect on regulating the planet's temperature. In terms of sea ice, climate model projections of Antarctic sea ice   extent are in reasonable agreement with the observations to date.   Climate models projected that Antarctica would be much slower in  responding to rising greenhouse gas concentrations than the Arctic.  In  large part, this reflects the nature of the ocean structure in  Antarctica, in which water warmed at the surface quickly mixes  downward, making it harder to melt ice. It also appears that  atmospheric greenhouse gases, as well as the loss of ozone, have  acted  to increase the winds around Antarctica. Perhaps  counterintuitively, this has further protected the Antarctic from  warming and has fostered more ice growth. The one region of Antarctica  that is strongly warming is the Antarctic Peninsula, which juts out  into the Atlantic Ocean and is thus less protected by the altered wind  pattern. The Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing ice shelf collapse  and strongly reduced sea  ice. Unlike Arctic sea ice, Antarctic sea ice disappears almost completely  during the summer, and has since scientists have studied it. Earth's  climate system over thousands of years has been \"in tune\" with this  annual summertime disappearance of Antarctic sea ice.  For more information, see State of the Cryosphere: Sea Ice.
